== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Include the shortcode [thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts] in any post or page.

= How do I include the results as a widget? =

On your Widgets page, simply drag and drop the widget to your sidebar!

=General results=
Without passing any parameters, the plugin will return ten results or fewer depending on how many posts you have.

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts(); ?&gt;

=Specific number of results=
If you would like to return a specific number of results as your maximum:

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts('count=10'); ?&gt;

=Altering the before and after values=<
By default the plugin wraps your code in list item (&lt;li&gt;) tags but you can specify how to format the results using the following code:

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts('before=&lt;p&gt;&amp;after=&lt;/p&gt;'); ?&gt;


=The Order=<
You can now change the order of the results using ASC, DESC or RAND to return the results in ascending, descending or random order.

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts('order=ASC'); ?&gt;


=Echo vs. Return=
Finally, if you'd like to copy the results into a variable you can return the results as follows:

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts('show=false'); ?&gt;

=Combining Arguements=

If you'd like to call multiple arguments you can do so by separating them with a & symbol:

&lt;?php thisismyurl_easy_similar_posts('show=false&order=ASC'); ?&gt;
